#The JavaScript_Quiz

##Purpose
This is a timed JavaScript quiz with a score.  The quiz starts when you click the "Start Quiz" button.  It is set on a 75 second timer 
for the five questions.  If a question is answered incorrectly, then you will lose 5 points off of your timer.  If the question is answered
correctly, you will receive 5 points.  The quiz is over when all questions are answered, or you run out of time.  You can enter your initials 
and see the score at the end.
